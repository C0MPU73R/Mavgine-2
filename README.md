Mavgine-2
=========

Mavgine 2 is an open source componet based game engine written in C++.
Although there are only visual studio projects in the repository at the moment(make a linux makefile and I will love you forever), all code will be cross-platform.


Mavgine 1 was developed under closed source. I&#39;m going to use the lessons I learned from it to develop Mavgine 2.
